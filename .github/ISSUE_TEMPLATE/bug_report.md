This is a  pre-formatted template:

- Lines starting with ### are section headers. Do not delete any of the sections.

- Lines starting with the label  [comment]: are instructions on how to fill in the section and will not be shown in your request. Just read what is required and add your answer below.

Choose a good title: The title will be listed in the changelog when the issue is fixed. Do you think someone else would understand what's fixed or done from your title? Does it really name the real topic of the issue?

Bug reports that are not properly filed might be closed without further notice.

For Linux see: https://github.com/Maproom/qmapshack/wiki/TroubleShooting#create-a-backtrace-of-a-crash-on-linux.
For Windows it would need a debug build and running QMapshack in Visual Studio.)
