This structure is used to store  OptGuard  report,  i.e.  report  on   the
properties of the nonlinear function being optimized with ALGLIB.

After you tell your optimizer to activate OptGuard  this technology starts
to silently monitor function values and gradients/Jacobians  being  passed
all around during your optimization session. Depending on specific set  of
checks enabled OptGuard may perform additional function evaluations  (say,
about 3*N evaluations if you want to check analytic gradient for errors).

Upon discovering that something strange happens  (function  values  and/or
gradient components change too sharply and/or unexpectedly) OptGuard  sets
one of the "suspicion  flags" (without interrupting optimization session).
After optimization is done, you can examine OptGuard report.

Following report fields can be set:
* nonc0suspected
* nonc1suspected
* badgradsuspected


=== WHAT CAN BE DETECTED WITH OptGuard INTEGRITY CHECKER =================

Following  types  of  errors  in your target function (constraints) can be
caught:
a) discontinuous functions ("non-C0" part of the report)
b) functions with discontinuous derivative ("non-C1" part of the report)
c) errors in the analytic gradient provided by user

These types of errors result in optimizer  stopping  well  before reaching
solution (most often - right after encountering discontinuity).

Type A errors are usually  coding  errors  during  implementation  of  the
target function. Most "normal" problems involve continuous functions,  and
anyway you can't reliably optimize discontinuous function.

Type B errors are either coding errors or (in case code itself is correct)
evidence of the fact  that  your  problem  is  an  "incorrect"  one.  Most
optimizers (except for ones provided by MINNS subpackage) do  not  support
nonsmooth problems.

Type C errors are coding errors which often prevent optimizer from  making
even one step  or result in optimizing stopping  too  early,  as  soon  as
actual descent direction becomes too different from one suggested by user-
supplied gradient.


=== WHAT IS REPORTED =====================================================

Following set of report fields deals with discontinuous  target functions,
ones not belonging to C0 continuity class:

* nonc0suspected - is a flag which is set upon discovering some indication
  of the discontinuity. If this flag is false, the rest of "non-C0" fields
  should be ignored
* nonc0fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function,  1  or
  higher for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C0"
* nonc0lipshitzc - a Lipchitz constant for a function which was  suspected
  of being non-continuous.
* nonc0test0positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
  continuity violation (test #0)

Following set of report fields deals with discontinuous gradient/Jacobian,
i.e. with functions violating C1 continuity:

* nonc1suspected - is a flag which is set upon discovering some indication
  of the discontinuity. If this flag is false, the rest of "non-C1" fields
  should be ignored
* nonc1fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function,  1  or
  higher for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
* nonc1lipshitzc - a Lipchitz constant for a function gradient  which  was
  suspected of being non-smooth.
* nonc1test0positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
  continuity violation (test #0)
* nonc1test1positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
  continuity violation (test #1)

Following set of report fields deals with errors in the gradient:
* badgradsuspected - is a flad which is set upon discovering an  error  in
  the analytic gradient supplied by user
* badgradfidx - index  of   the  function  with bad gradient (0 for target
  function, 1 or higher for nonlinear constraints)
* badgradvidx - index of the variable
* badgradxbase - location where Jacobian is tested
* following  matrices  store  user-supplied  Jacobian  and  its  numerical
  differentiation version (which is assumed to be  free  from  the  coding
  errors), both of them computed near the initial point:
  * badgraduser, an array[K,N], analytic Jacobian supplied by user
  * badgradnum,  an array[K,N], numeric  Jacobian computed by ALGLIB
  Here K is a total number of  nonlinear  functions  (target  +  nonlinear
  constraints), N is a variable number.
  The  element  of  badgraduser[] with index [badgradfidx,badgradvidx]  is
  assumed to be wrong.

More detailed error log can  be  obtained  from  optimizer  by  explicitly
requesting reports for tests C0.0, C1.0, C1.1.

/*************************************************************************
This  structure  is  used  for  detailed   reporting  about  suspected  C1
continuity violation as flagged by C1 test #0 (OptGuard  has several tests
for C1 continuity, this report is used by #0).

=== WHAT IS TESTED =======================================================

C1 test #0 studies function values (not gradient!)  obtained  during  line
searches and monitors behavior of directional  derivative  estimate.  This
test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  gradient
values  and  thus  it  is  more  robust  against  artifacts  introduced by
numerical differentiation.


=== WHAT IS REPORTED =====================================================

Actually, report retrieval function returns TWO report structures:

* one for most suspicious point found so far (one with highest  change  in
  the directional derivative), so called "strongest" report
* another one for most detailed line search (more function  evaluations  =
  easier to understand what's going on) which triggered  test #0 criteria,
  so called "longest" report

In both cases following fields are returned:

* positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
  did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
* fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, 1 or higher
  for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
* x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
  for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
* stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function
  values at these points; f[i] is evaluated in x0+stp[i]*d.
* stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
  between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,
  with  most  likely  position  of  the  violation  between  stpidxa+1 and
  stpidxa+2.

You can plot function values stored in stp[]  and  f[]  arrays  and  study
behavior of your function by your own eyes, just  to  be  sure  that  test
correctly reported C1 violation.

This  structure  is  used  for  detailed   reporting  about  suspected  C1
continuity violation as flagged by C1 test #1 (OptGuard  has several tests
for C1 continuity, this report is used by #1).

=== WHAT IS TESTED =======================================================

C1 test #1 studies individual  components  of  the  gradient  as  recorded
during line searches. Upon discovering discontinuity in the gradient  this
test records specific component which was suspected (or  one  with  highest
indication of discontinuity if multiple components are suspected).

When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
continuity is violated.

  for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being "non-C1"
* vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth derivative
* x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
  for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
* stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  gradient
  values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in  x0+stp[i]*d  and  contains
  vidx-th component of the gradient.

/*************************************************************************
        LIMITED MEMORY BFGS METHOD FOR LARGE SCALE OPTIMIZATION

DESCRIPTION:
The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by  using  a  quasi-
Newton method (LBFGS scheme) which is optimized to use  a  minimum  amount
of memory.
The subroutine generates the approximation of an inverse Hessian matrix by
using information about the last M steps of the algorithm  (instead of N).
It lessens a required amount of memory from a value  of  order  N^2  to  a
value of order 2*N*M.


REQUIREMENTS:
Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
* function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLBFGSCreate() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLBFGSSetCond() MinLBFGSSetStpMax()
   and other functions
3. User calls MinLBFGSOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
4. User calls MinLBFGSResults() to get solution
5. Optionally user may call MinLBFGSRestartFrom() to solve another problem
   with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
   MinLBFGSRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension. N>0
    M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                approximation update. Recommended value:  3<=M<=7. The smaller
                value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                performance. M<=N.
    X       -   initial solution approximation, array[0..N-1].


OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state


NOTES:
1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLBFGSSetCond() function
2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
   optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
   use MinLBFGSSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's  steps.  However,
   L-BFGS rarely needs such a tuning.

/*************************************************************************
The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinLBFGSCreate().  It  uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinLBFGSCreate() in  order  to  get
more information about creation of LBFGS optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X

                considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                performance. M<=N.
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinLBFGSSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is   less  robust  and  precise.  LBFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
   Imprecise gradient may slow  down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
   nonlinear problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

This function sets scaling coefficients for LBFGS optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) "how large" the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  LBFGS  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinLBFGSSetPrec...()
functions.

There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
analytic gradient.

Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
(note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
suspicious by the OptGuard.

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minlbfgsoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep>0 activates verification
                    You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                    numerical derivative.

                    You may use different step for different parameters by
                    means of setting scale with minlbfgssetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.

      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.

      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

/*************************************************************************
Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* minlbfgsoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* minlbfgsoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
    single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
    complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
  * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
    differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
    report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
    or MinLM)
* rep.nonc0suspected
* rep.nonc1suspected

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* minlbfgsoptguardnonc1test0results()
* minlbfgsoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.

      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.

      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

Nonsmoothness (non-C1) test #0 studies  function  values  (not  gradient!)
obtained during line searches and monitors  behavior  of  the  directional
derivative estimate.

This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the
gradient values and thus it is more robust against artifacts introduced by
numerical differentiation.

Two reports are returned:
* a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
  value of the nonsmoothness indicator
* a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
  evaluations, and thus is more detailed

In both cases following fields are returned:

* positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
  did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
* x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
  for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
* stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function
  values at these points; f[i] is evaluated in x0+stp[i]*d.
* stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity

Detailed results of the OptGuard integrity check for nonsmoothness test #1

Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
gradient computed during line search.

When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
continuity is violated.

Two reports are returned:
* a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
  value of the nonsmoothness indicator
* a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function

                     BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
       WITH ADDITIONAL LINEAR EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

DESCRIPTION:
The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
combination of:
* bound constraints
* linear inequality constraints
* linear equality constraints

REQUIREMENTS:
* user must provide function value and gradient
* starting point X0 must be feasible or
  not too far away from the feasible set
* grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
  L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }
* function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

USAGE:

Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
Here we give very brief outline of the BLEIC optimizer. We strongly recommend
you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBLEICCreate() call

2. USer adds boundary and/or linear constraints by calling
   MinBLEICSetBC() and MinBLEICSetLC() functions.

3. User sets stopping conditions with MinBLEICSetCond().

4. User calls MinBLEICOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

5. User calls MinBLEICResults() to get solution

6. Optionally user may call MinBLEICRestartFrom() to solve another problem
   with same N but another starting point.
   MinBLEICRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.

NOTE: if you have box-only constraints (no  general  linear  constraints),
      then MinBC optimizer can be better option. It uses  special,  faster
      constraint activation method, which performs better on problems with
      multiple constraints active at the solution.

      On small-scale problems performance of MinBC is similar to  that  of
      MinBLEIC, but on large-scale ones (hundreds and thousands of  active
      constraints) it can be several times faster than MinBLEIC.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
    X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                  to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                  approximation.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

/*************************************************************************
The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBLEICCreate().  It  uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinBLEICCreate() in  order  to  get
more information about creation of BLEIC optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBLEICSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
   gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
   problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

NOTE 1: linear (non-bound) constraints are satisfied only approximately:
* there always exists some minor violation (about Epsilon in magnitude)
  due to rounding errors
* numerical differentiation, if used, may  lead  to  function  evaluations
  outside  of the feasible  area,   because   algorithm  does  NOT  change
  numerical differentiation formula according to linear constraints.
If you want constraints to be  satisfied  exactly, try to reformulate your
problem  in  such  manner  that  all constraints will become boundary ones
(this kind of constraints is always satisfied exactly, both in  the  final
solution and in all intermediate points).

      limit on iterations count.

/*************************************************************************
This function sets scaling coefficients for BLEIC optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) "how large" the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BLEIC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBLEICSetPrec...()
functions.

There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
(note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session

which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minbleicoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating

                    means of setting scale with minbleicsetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.

      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.

      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* minbleicoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* minbleicoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
    single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
    complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
  * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
    differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
    report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
    or MinLM)
* rep.nonc0suspected
* rep.nonc1suspected

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* minbleicoptguardnonc1test0results()
* minbleicoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.

      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.

      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

constraints. You should set quadratic/linear terms with calls to functions
provided by MinQP subpackage.

You should also choose appropriate QP solver and set it  and  its stopping

solution process by means of MinQPOptimize() call. Solution itself can  be
obtained with MinQPResults() function.

Following solvers are recommended:
* QuickQP for dense problems with box-only constraints (or no constraints
  at all)
* QP-BLEIC for dense/sparse problems with moderate (up to 50) number of
  general linear constraints
* DENSE-AUL-QP for dense problems with any (small or large) number of

This function tells solver to use BLEIC-based algorithm and sets  stopping
criteria for the algorithm.

This algorithm is fast  enough  for large-scale  problems  with  following
properties:
a) feasible initial point, moderate amount of general linear constraints
b) arbitrary (can be infeasible) initial point, small  amount  of  general
   linear constraints (say, hundred or less)

If you solve large-scale QP problem with many inequality  constraints  and
without initial feasibility guarantees, consider  using  DENSE-AUL  solver
instead. Initial feasibility detection stage by BLEIC may take too long on
such problems.

ALGORITHM FEATURES:

* supports dense and sparse QP problems
* supports box and general linear equality/inequality constraints
* can solve all types of problems  (convex,  semidefinite,  nonconvex)  as
  long as they are bounded from below under constraints.
  Say, it is possible to solve "min{-x^2} subject to -1<=x<=+1".
  Of course, global  minimum  is found only  for  positive  definite   and
  semidefinite  problems.  As  for indefinite ones - only local minimum is
  found.

ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

* BLEIC-QP solver is just a driver function for MinBLEIC solver; it solves
  quadratic  programming   problem   as   general   linearly   constrained
  optimization problem, which is solved by means of BLEIC solver  (part of
  ALGLIB, active set method).

ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:
* This algorithm is inefficient on  problems with hundreds  and  thousands
  of general inequality constraints and infeasible initial point.  Initial
  feasibility detection stage may take too long on such constraint sets.
  Consider using DENSE-AUL instead.
* unlike QuickQP solver, this algorithm does not perform Newton steps  and
  does not use Level 3 BLAS. Being general-purpose active set  method,  it
  can activate constraints only one-by-one. Thus, its performance is lower
  than that of QuickQP.
* its precision is also a bit  inferior  to  that  of   QuickQP.  BLEIC-QP
  performs only LBFGS steps (no Newton steps), which are good at detecting
  neighborhood of the solution, buy needs many iterations to find solution
  with more than 6 digits of precision.

                function value only a bit. So you will need many iterations

  In convex/semidefinite case global minimum  is  returned,  in  nonconvex
  case - algorithm returns one of the local minimums.

ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

* algorithm  performs  two kinds of iterations: constrained CG  iterations
  and constrained Newton iterations
* initially it performs small number of constrained CG  iterations,  which
  can efficiently activate/deactivate multiple constraints
* after CG phase algorithm tries to calculate Cholesky  decomposition  and
  to perform several constrained Newton steps. If  Cholesky  decomposition
  failed (matrix is indefinite even under constraints),  we  perform  more
  CG iterations until we converge to such set of constraints  that  system
  matrix becomes  positive  definite.  Constrained  Newton  steps  greatly
  increase convergence speed and precision.
* algorithm interleaves CG and Newton iterations which  allows  to  handle
  indefinite matrices (CG phase) and quickly converge after final  set  of
  constraints is found (Newton phase). Combination of CG and Newton phases
  is called "outer iteration".
* it is possible to turn off Newton  phase  (beneficial  for  semidefinite
  problems - Cholesky decomposition will fail too often)

ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:

* algorithm does not support general  linear  constraints;  only  box ones
  are supported
* Cholesky decomposition for sparse problems  is  performed  with  Skyline
  Cholesky solver, which is intended for low-profile matrices. No profile-
  reducing reordering of variables is performed in this version of ALGLIB.
* problems with near-zero negative eigenvalues (or exacty zero  ones)  may
  experience about 2-3x performance penalty. The reason is  that  Cholesky
  decomposition can not be performed until we identify directions of  zero
  and negative curvature and activate corresponding boundary constraints -
  but we need a lot of trial and errors because these directions  are hard
  to notice in the matrix spectrum.
  In this case you may turn off Newton phase of algorithm.
  Large negative eigenvalues  are  not  an  issue,  so  highly  non-convex
  problems can be solved very efficiently.

                includes some amount of CG iterations (from 5 to  ~N)  and
                one or several (usually small amount) Newton steps.  Thus,
                one outer iteration has high cost, but can greatly  reduce
                funcation value.
                Use 0 if you do not want to limit number of outer iterations.
    UseNewton-  use Newton phase or not:
                * Newton phase improves performance of  positive  definite
                  dense problems (about 2 times improvement can be observed)
                * can result in some performance penalty  on  semidefinite
                  or slightly negative definite  problems  -  each  Newton
                  phase will bring no improvement (Cholesky failure),  but
                  still will require computational time.
                * if you doubt, you can turn off this  phase  -  optimizer
                  will retain its most of its high speed.

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL MinQPSetScale() WHEN YOU USE THIS  ALGORITHM
BECAUSE ITS STOPPING CRITERIA ARE SCALE-DEPENDENT!

Passing EpsG=0, EpsF=0 and EpsX=0 and MaxIts=0 (simultaneously) will lead
to automatic stopping criterion selection (presently it is  small    step
length, but it may change in the future versions of ALGLIB).

                  NONLINEARLY  CONSTRAINED  OPTIMIZATION
            WITH PRECONDITIONED AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN ALGORITHM

DESCRIPTION:
The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
combination of:
* bound constraints
* linear inequality constraints
* linear equality constraints
* nonlinear equality constraints Gi(x)=0
* nonlinear inequality constraints Hi(x)<=0

REQUIREMENTS:
* user must provide function value and gradient for F(), H(), G()
* starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from the feasible
  set
* F(), G(), H() are twice continuously differentiable on the feasible  set
  and its neighborhood
* nonlinear constraints G() and H() must have non-zero gradient at  G(x)=0
  and at H(x)=0. Say, constraint like x^2>=1 is supported, but x^2>=0   is
  NOT supported.

USAGE:

Constrained optimization if far more complex than the  unconstrained  one.
Nonlinearly constrained optimization is one of the most esoteric numerical
procedures.

Here we give very brief outline  of  the  MinNLC  optimizer.  We  strongly
recommend you to study examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read
ALGLIB User Guide on optimization, which is available at
http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

1. User initializes algorithm state with MinNLCCreate() call  and  chooses
   what NLC solver to use. There is some solver which is used by  default,
   with default settings, but you should NOT rely on  default  choice.  It
   may change in future releases of ALGLIB without notice, and no one  can
   guarantee that new solver will be  able  to  solve  your  problem  with
   default settings.

   From the other side, if you choose solver explicitly, you can be pretty
   sure that it will work with new ALGLIB releases.

   In the current release following solvers can be used:
   * SLP solver (activated with minnlcsetalgoslp() function) -  successive
     linear programming, recommended as the first step.
   * AUL solver (activated with minnlcsetalgoaul() function)  -  augmented
     Lagrangian method with dense preconditioner.

   SLP solver is the most robust one  in  ALGLIB  and  converges  in  less
   iterations than AUL; however, each iteration has higher overhead  -  we
   have to solve an LP problem. From  the  other  side,  AUL  has  cheaper
   iterations - although it typically needs more of them, and also  it  is
   less robust in nonconvex setting.

2. [optional] user activates OptGuard  integrity checker  which  tries  to
   detect possible errors in the user-supplied callbacks:
   * discontinuity/nonsmoothness of the target/nonlinear constraints
   * errors in the analytic gradient provided by user
   This feature is essential for early prototyping stages because it helps
   to catch common coding and problem statement errors.
   OptGuard can be activated with following functions (one per each  check
   performed):
   * minnlcoptguardsmoothness()
   * minnlcoptguardgradient()

3. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear constraints by  means
   of calling one of the following functions:
   a) minnlcsetbc() for boundary constraints
   b) minnlcsetlc() for linear constraints
   c) minnlcsetnlc() for nonlinear constraints
   You may combine (a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.

4. User sets scale of the variables with minnlcsetscale() function. It  is
   VERY important to set  scale  of  the  variables,  because  nonlinearly
   constrained problems are hard to solve when variables are badly scaled.

5. User sets  stopping  conditions  with  minnlcsetcond(). If  NLC  solver
   uses  inner/outer  iteration  layout,  this  function   sets   stopping
   conditions for INNER iterations.

6. Finally, user calls minnlcoptimize()  function  which  takes  algorithm
   state and pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates
   F/G/H.

7. User calls  minnlcresults()  to  get  solution;  additionally  you  can
   retrieve OptGuard report with minnlcoptguardresults(), and get detailed
   report about purported errors in the target function with:
   * minnlcoptguardnonc1test0results()
   * minnlcoptguardnonc1test1results()

8. Optionally user may call minnlcrestartfrom() to solve  another  problem
   with same N but another starting point. minnlcrestartfrom()  allows  to
   reuse already initialized structure.

/*************************************************************************
This subroutine is a finite  difference variant of MinNLCCreate(). It uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to this  function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinNLCCreate() in order to get more
information about creation of NLC optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:

                * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX

                  approximation.
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinNLCSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large TRUNCATION  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large NUMERICAL  errors.  1.0E-4  can  be  good
   value to start from.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less   robust   and  precise.  Imprecise  gradient  may  slow  down
   convergence, especially on highly nonlinear problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

This  function  tells MinNLC unit to use  Augmented  Lagrangian  algorithm
for nonlinearly constrained  optimization.  This  algorithm  is  a  slight
modification of one described in "A Modified Barrier-Augmented  Lagrangian
Method for  Constrained  Minimization  (1999)"  by  D.GOLDFARB,  R.POLYAK,
K. SCHEINBERG, I.YUZEFOVICH.

AUL solver can be significantly faster than SLP on easy problems, although
it is less robust than SLP (the "gold standard" of robust optimization).

Augmented Lagrangian algorithm works by converting problem  of  minimizing
F(x) subject to equality/inequality constraints   to unconstrained problem
of the form

    min[ f(x) +
        + Rho*PENALTY_EQ(x)   + SHIFT_EQ(x,Nu1) +
        + Rho*PENALTY_INEQ(x) + SHIFT_INEQ(x,Nu2) ]

where:
* Rho is a fixed penalization coefficient
* PENALTY_EQ(x) is a penalty term, which is used to APPROXIMATELY  enforce
  equality constraints
* SHIFT_EQ(x) is a special "shift"  term  which  is  used  to  "fine-tune"
  equality constraints, greatly increasing precision
* PENALTY_INEQ(x) is a penalty term which is used to approximately enforce
  inequality constraints
* SHIFT_INEQ(x) is a special "shift"  term  which  is  used to "fine-tune"
  inequality constraints, greatly increasing precision
* Nu1/Nu2 are vectors of Lagrange coefficients which are fine-tuned during
  outer iterations of algorithm

This  version  of  AUL  algorithm  uses   preconditioner,  which   greatly
accelerates convergence. Because this  algorithm  is  similar  to  penalty
methods,  it  may  perform  steps  into  infeasible  area.  All  kinds  of
constraints (boundary, linear and nonlinear ones) may   be   violated   in
intermediate points - and in the solution.  However,  properly  configured
AUL method is significantly better at handling  constraints  than  barrier
and/or penalty methods.

The very basic outline of algorithm is given below:
1) first outer iteration is performed with "default"  values  of  Lagrange
   multipliers Nu1/Nu2. Solution quality is low (candidate  point  can  be
   too  far  away  from  true  solution; large violation of constraints is
   possible) and is comparable with that of penalty methods.
2) subsequent outer iterations  refine  Lagrange  multipliers  and improve
   quality of the solution.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    Rho     -   penalty coefficient, Rho>0:
                * large enough  that  algorithm  converges  with   desired
                  precision. Minimum value is 10*max(S'*diag(H)*S),  where
                  S is a scale matrix (set by MinNLCSetScale) and H  is  a
                  Hessian of the function being minimized. If you can  not
                  easily estimate Hessian norm,  see  our  recommendations
                  below.
                * not TOO large to prevent ill-conditioning
                * for unit-scale problems (variables and Hessian have unit
                  magnitude), Rho=100 or Rho=1000 can be used.
                * it is important to note that Rho is internally multiplied
                  by scaling matrix, i.e. optimum value of Rho depends  on
                  scale of variables specified  by  MinNLCSetScale().
    ItsCnt  -   number of outer iterations:
                * ItsCnt=0 means that small number of outer iterations  is
                  automatically chosen (10 iterations in current version).
                * ItsCnt=1 means that AUL algorithm performs just as usual
                  barrier method.
                * ItsCnt>1 means that  AUL  algorithm  performs  specified
                  number of outer iterations

HOW TO CHOOSE PARAMETERS

Nonlinear optimization is a tricky area and Augmented Lagrangian algorithm
is sometimes hard to tune. Good values of  Rho  and  ItsCnt  are  problem-
specific.  In  order  to  help  you   we   prepared   following   set   of
recommendations:

* for  unit-scale  problems  (variables  and Hessian have unit magnitude),
  Rho=100 or Rho=1000 can be used.

* start from  some  small  value of Rho and solve problem  with  just  one
  outer iteration (ItcCnt=1). In this case algorithm behaves like  penalty
  method. Increase Rho in 2x or 10x steps until you  see  that  one  outer
  iteration returns point which is "rough approximation to solution".

  It is very important to have Rho so  large  that  penalty  term  becomes
  constraining i.e. modified function becomes highly convex in constrained
  directions.

  From the other side, too large Rho may prevent you  from  converging  to
  the solution. You can diagnose it by studying number of inner iterations
  performed by algorithm: too few (5-10 on  1000-dimensional  problem)  or
  too many (orders of magnitude more than  dimensionality)  usually  means
  that Rho is too large.

* with just one outer iteration you  usually  have  low-quality  solution.
  Some constraints can be violated with very  large  margin,  while  other
  ones (which are NOT violated in the true solution) can push final  point
  too far in the inner area of the feasible set.

  For example, if you have constraint x0>=0 and true solution  x0=1,  then
  merely a presence of "x0>=0" will introduce a bias towards larger values
  of x0. Say, algorithm may stop at x0=1.5 instead of 1.0.

* after you found good Rho, you may increase number of  outer  iterations.
  ItsCnt=10 is a good value. Subsequent outer iteration will refine values
  of  Lagrange  multipliers.  Constraints  which  were  violated  will  be
  enforced, inactive constraints will be dropped (corresponding multipliers
  will be decreased). Ideally, you  should  see  10-1000x  improvement  in
  constraint handling (constraint violation is reduced).

* if  you  see  that  algorithm  converges  to  vicinity  of solution, but
  additional outer iterations do not refine solution,  it  may  mean  that
  algorithm is unstable - it wanders around true  solution,  but  can  not
  approach it. Sometimes algorithm may be stabilized by increasing Rho one
  more time, making it 5x or 10x larger.

SCALING OF CONSTRAINTS [IMPORTANT]

AUL optimizer scales   variables   according   to   scale   specified   by
MinNLCSetScale() function, so it can handle  problems  with  badly  scaled
variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).   However,  because  function
being optimized is a mix  of  original  function and  constraint-dependent
penalty  functions, it  is   important  to   rescale  both  variables  AND
constraints.

Say,  if  you  minimize f(x)=x^2 subject to 1000000*x>=0,  then  you  have
constraint whose scale is different from that of target  function (another
example is 0.000001*x>=0). It is also possible to have constraints   whose
scales  are   misaligned:   1000000*x0>=0, 0.000001*x1<=0.   Inappropriate
scaling may ruin convergence because minimizing x^2 subject to x>=0 is NOT
same as minimizing it subject to 1000000*x>=0.

Because we  know  coefficients  of  boundary/linear  constraints,  we  can
automatically rescale and normalize them. However,  there  is  no  way  to
automatically rescale nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and  Hi(x)  -  they  are
black boxes.

It means that YOU are the one who is  responsible  for  correct scaling of
nonlinear constraints  Gi(x)  and  Hi(x).  We  recommend  you  to  rescale
nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component of dG/dX (or  dH/dx)
has magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i] (where S  is  a  scale  set by
MinNLCSetScale() function).

WHAT IF IT DOES NOT CONVERGE?

It is possible that AUL algorithm fails to converge to precise  values  of
Lagrange multipliers. It stops somewhere around true solution, but candidate
point is still too far from solution, and some constraints  are  violated.
Such kind of failure is specific for Lagrangian algorithms -  technically,
they stop at some point, but this point is not constrained solution.

There are exist several reasons why algorithm may fail to converge:
a) too loose stopping criteria for inner iteration
b) degenerate, redundant constraints
c) target function has unconstrained extremum exactly at the  boundary  of
   some constraint
d) numerical noise in the target function

In all these cases algorithm is unstable - each outer iteration results in
large and almost random step which improves handling of some  constraints,
but violates other ones (ideally  outer iterations should form a  sequence
of progressively decreasing steps towards solution).

First reason possible is  that  too  loose  stopping  criteria  for  inner
iteration were specified. Augmented Lagrangian algorithm solves a sequence
of intermediate problems, and requries each of them to be solved with high
precision. Insufficient precision results in incorrect update of  Lagrange
multipliers.

Another reason is that you may have specified degenerate constraints: say,
some constraint was repeated twice. In most cases AUL algorithm gracefully
handles such situations, but sometimes it may spend too much time figuring
out subtle degeneracies in constraint matrix.

Third reason is tricky and hard to diagnose. Consider situation  when  you
minimize  f=x^2  subject to constraint x>=0.  Unconstrained   extremum  is
located  exactly  at  the  boundary  of  constrained  area.  In  this case
algorithm will tend to oscillate between negative  and  positive  x.  Each
time it stops at x<0 it "reinforces" constraint x>=0, and each time it  is
bounced to x>0 it "relaxes" constraint (and is  attracted  to  x<0).

Such situation  sometimes  happens  in  problems  with  hidden  symetries.
Algorithm  is  got  caught  in  a  loop with  Lagrange  multipliers  being
continuously increased/decreased. Luckily, such loop forms after at  least
three iterations, so this problem can be solved by  DECREASING  number  of
outer iterations down to 1-2 and increasing  penalty  coefficient  Rho  as
much as possible.

Final reason is numerical noise. AUL algorithm is robust against  moderate
noise (more robust than, say, active set methods),  but  large  noise  may
destabilize algorithm.

/*************************************************************************
This   function  tells  MinNLC  optimizer  to  use  SLP (Successive Linear
Programming) algorithm for  nonlinearly  constrained   optimization.  This
algorithm  is  a  slight  modification  of  one  described  in  "A  Linear
programming-based optimization algorithm for solving nonlinear programming
problems" (2010) by Claus Still and Tapio Westerlund.

Despite its name ("linear" = "first order method") this algorithm performs
steps similar to that of conjugate gradients method;  internally  it  uses
orthogonality/conjugacy requirement for subsequent steps  which  makes  it
closer to second order methods in terms of convergence speed.

Convergence is proved for the following case:
* function and constraints are continuously differentiable (C1 class)
* extended Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification  (EMFCQ)  holds;
  in the context of this algorithm EMFCQ  means  that  one  can,  for  any
  infeasible  point,  find  a  search  direction  such that the constraint
  infeasibilities are reduced.

This algorithm has following nice properties:
* no parameters to tune
* no convexity requirements for target function or constraints
* initial point can be infeasible
* algorithm respects box constraints in all intermediate points  (it  does
  not even evaluate function outside of box constrained area)
* once linear constraints are enforced, algorithm will not violate them
* no such guarantees can be provided for nonlinear constraints,  but  once
  nonlinear constraints are enforced, algorithm will try  to  respect them
  as much as possible
* numerical differentiation does not  violate  box  constraints  (although
  general linear and nonlinear ones can be violated during differentiation)

However, following drawbacks can be noted:
* algorithm performance decreased on problems with dense constraints
* it has higher iteration cost than AUL - we have to solve an  LP  problem
  at each step.

We recommend this algorithm as a first step; as soon as you make sure that
it converges, you can try switching to AUL which is sometimes much faster.

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you

/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0) and/or constraints
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1) and/or constraints

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.

      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.

      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* minnlcoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* minnlcoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradfidx for specific function (Jacobian row) suspected
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (Jacobian column) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient/Jacobian is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient/Jacobian
  * rep.badgradnum, reference gradient/Jacobian obtained via numerical
    differentiation
* rep.nonc0suspected, and additionally:
  * rep.nonc0fidx - an index of specific function violating C0 continuity
* rep.nonc1suspected, and additionally
  * rep.nonc1fidx - an index of specific function violating C1 continuity
Here function index 0 means  target function, index 1  or  higher  denotes
nonlinear constraints.

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* minnlcoptguardnonc1test0results()
* minnlcoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

INPUT PARAMETERS:

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.

      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.

      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

                     BOX CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
          WITH FAST ACTIVATION OF MULTIPLE BOX CONSTRAINTS

DESCRIPTION:
The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x) of N arguments subject  to box
constraints (with some of box constraints actually being equality ones).

This optimizer uses algorithm similar to that of MinBLEIC (optimizer  with
general linear constraints), but presence of box-only  constraints  allows
us to use faster constraint activation strategies. On large-scale problems,
with multiple constraints active at the solution, this  optimizer  can  be
several times faster than BLEIC.

REQUIREMENTS:
* user must provide function value and gradient
* starting point X0 must be feasible or
  not too far away from the feasible set
* grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
  L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }
* function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

USAGE:

Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
Here we give very brief outline of the BC optimizer. We strongly recommend
you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBCCreate() call

2. USer adds box constraints by calling MinBCSetBC() function.

3. User sets stopping conditions with MinBCSetCond().

4. User calls MinBCOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

5. User calls MinBCResults() to get solution

6. Optionally user may call MinBCRestartFrom() to solve another problem
   with same N but another starting point.
   MinBCRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
    X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                  to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                  approximation.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

/*************************************************************************
The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBCCreate().  It  uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinBCCreate() in  order  to  get
more information about creation of BC optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBCSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
   gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
   problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

/*************************************************************************
This function sets scaling coefficients for BC optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) "how large" the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBCSetPrec...()
functions.

There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied

Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
(note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
suspicious by the OptGuard.

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minbcoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep>0 activates verification
                    You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                    numerical derivative.

                    You may use different step for different parameters by
                    means of setting scale with minbcsetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.

      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.

      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* minbcoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* minbcoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
    single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
    complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
  * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
    differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
    report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
    or MinLM)
* rep.nonc0suspected
* rep.nonc1suspected

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* minbcoptguardnonc1test0results()
* minbcoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.

      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.

      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

                  NONSMOOTH NONCONVEX OPTIMIZATION
            SUBJECT TO BOX/LINEAR/NONLINEAR-NONSMOOTH CONSTRAINTS

DESCRIPTION:

The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
combination of:
* bound constraints
* linear inequality constraints
* linear equality constraints
* nonlinear equality constraints Gi(x)=0
* nonlinear inequality constraints Hi(x)<=0

IMPORTANT: see MinNSSetAlgoAGS for important  information  on  performance
           restrictions of AGS solver.

REQUIREMENTS:
* starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from the feasible
  set
* F(), G(), H() are continuous, locally Lipschitz  and  continuously  (but
  not necessarily twice) differentiable in an open dense  subset  of  R^N.
  Functions F(), G() and H() may be nonsmooth and non-convex.
  Informally speaking, it means  that  functions  are  composed  of  large
  differentiable "patches" with nonsmoothness having  place  only  at  the
  boundaries between these "patches".
  Most real-life nonsmooth  functions  satisfy  these  requirements.  Say,
  anything which involves finite number of abs(), min() and max() is  very
  likely to pass the test.
  Say, it is possible to optimize anything of the following:
  * f=abs(x0)+2*abs(x1)
  * f=max(x0,x1)
  * f=sin(max(x0,x1)+abs(x2))
* for nonlinearly constrained problems: F()  must  be  bounded from  below
  without nonlinear constraints (this requirement is due to the fact that,
  contrary to box and linear constraints, nonlinear ones  require  special
  handling).
* user must provide function value and gradient for F(), H(), G()  at  all
  points where function/gradient can be calculated. If optimizer  requires
  value exactly at the boundary between "patches" (say, at x=0 for f=abs(x)),
  where gradient is not defined, user may resolve tie arbitrarily (in  our
  case - return +1 or -1 at its discretion).
* NS solver supports numerical differentiation, i.e. it may  differentiate
  your function for you,  but  it  results  in  2N  increase  of  function
  evaluations. Not recommended unless you solve really small problems. See
  minnscreatef() for more information on this functionality.

USAGE:

1. User initializes algorithm state with MinNSCreate() call  and   chooses
   what NLC solver to use. There is some solver which is used by  default,
   with default settings, but you should NOT rely on  default  choice.  It
   may change in future releases of ALGLIB without notice, and no one  can
   guarantee that new solver will be  able  to  solve  your  problem  with
   default settings.

   From the other side, if you choose solver explicitly, you can be pretty
   sure that it will work with new ALGLIB releases.

   In the current release following solvers can be used:
   * AGS solver (activated with MinNSSetAlgoAGS() function)

2. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear constraints by  means
   of calling one of the following functions:
   a) MinNSSetBC() for boundary constraints
   b) MinNSSetLC() for linear constraints
   c) MinNSSetNLC() for nonlinear constraints
   You may combine (a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.

3. User sets scale of the variables with MinNSSetScale() function. It   is
   VERY important to set  scale  of  the  variables,  because  nonlinearly
   constrained problems are hard to solve when variables are badly scaled.

4. User sets stopping conditions with MinNSSetCond().

5. Finally, user calls MinNSOptimize()  function  which  takes   algorithm
   state and pointer (delegate, etc) to callback function which calculates
   F/G/H.

7. User calls MinNSResults() to get solution

8. Optionally user may call MinNSRestartFrom() to solve   another  problem
   with same N but another starting point. MinNSRestartFrom()  allows   to
   reuse already initialized structure.

  of penalty method to handle constraints.
* numerical differentiation, if used, may  lead  to  function  evaluations
  outside  of the feasible  area,   because   algorithm  does  NOT  change
  numerical differentiation formula according to linear constraints.

problem  in  such  manner  that  all constraints will become boundary ones
(this kind of constraints is always satisfied exactly, both in  the  final

/*************************************************************************
This function sets nonlinear constraints.

In fact, this function sets NUMBER of nonlinear  constraints.  Constraints
itself (constraint functions) are passed to minnsoptimize() method.   This
method requires user-defined vector function F[]  and  its  Jacobian  J[],
where:
* first component of F[] and first row  of  Jacobian  J[]  correspond   to
  function being minimized
* next NLEC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
  equality constraints G_i(x)=0
* next NLIC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
  inequality constraints H_i(x)<=0

NOTE: you may combine nonlinear constraints with linear/boundary ones.  If
      your problem has mixed constraints, you  may explicitly specify some
      of them as linear ones. It may help optimizer to  handle  them  more
      efficiently.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure previously allocated with minnscreate() call.
    NLEC    -   number of Non-Linear Equality Constraints (NLEC), >=0
    NLIC    -   number of Non-Linear Inquality Constraints (NLIC), >=0

NOTE 1: nonlinear constraints are satisfied only  approximately!   It   is
        possible   that  algorithm  will  evaluate  function  outside   of
        the feasible area!

NOTE 2: algorithm scales variables  according  to   scale   specified   by
        minnssetscale()  function,  so  it can handle problems with  badly
        scaled variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).

        However,  there  is  no  way  to  automatically  scale   nonlinear
        constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). Inappropriate scaling  of  Gi/Hi  may
        ruin convergence. Solving problem with  constraint  "1000*G0(x)=0"
        is NOT same as solving it with constraint "0.001*G0(x)=0".

        It  means  that  YOU  are  the  one who is responsible for correct
        scaling of nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend you
        to scale nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component  of
        dG/dX (or dH/dx) has approximately unit  magnitude  (for  problems
        with unit scale)  or  has  magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i]
        (where S is a scale set by minnssetscale() function).

NOTE 3: nonlinear constraints are always hard to handle,  no  matter  what
        algorithm you try to use. Even basic box/linear constraints modify
        function  curvature   by  adding   valleys  and  ridges.  However,
        nonlinear constraints add valleys which are very  hard  to  follow
        due to their "curved" nature.

        It means that optimization with single nonlinear constraint may be
        significantly slower than optimization with multiple linear  ones.
        It is normal situation, and we recommend you to  carefully  choose
        Rho parameter of minnssetalgoags(), because too  large  value  may
        slow down convergence.

/*************************************************************************
This function tells MinNS unit to use  AGS  (adaptive  gradient  sampling)
algorithm for nonsmooth constrained  optimization.  This  algorithm  is  a
slight modification of one described in  "An  Adaptive  Gradient  Sampling
Algorithm for Nonsmooth Optimization" by Frank E. Curtisy and Xiaocun Quez.

This optimizer has following benefits and drawbacks:
+ robustness; it can be used with nonsmooth and nonconvex functions.
+ relatively easy tuning; most of the metaparameters are easy to select.
- it has convergence of steepest descent, slower than CG/LBFGS.
- each iteration involves evaluation of ~2N gradient values  and  solution
  of 2Nx2N quadratic programming problem, which  limits  applicability  of
  algorithm by small-scale problems (up to 50-100).

IMPORTANT: this  algorithm  has  convergence  guarantees,   i.e.  it  will
           steadily move towards some stationary point of the function.

           However, "stationary point" does not  always  mean  "solution".
           Nonsmooth problems often have "flat spots",  i.e.  areas  where
           function do not change at all. Such "flat spots" are stationary
           points by definition, and algorithm may be caught here.

           Nonsmooth CONVEX tasks are not prone to  this  problem. Say, if
           your function has form f()=MAX(f0,f1,...), and f_i are  convex,
           then f() is convex too and you have guaranteed  convergence  to
           solution.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    Radius  -   initial sampling radius, >=0.

                Internally multiplied  by  vector of  per-variable  scales
                specified by minnssetscale()).

                You should select relatively large sampling radius, roughly
                proportional to scaled length of the first  steps  of  the
                algorithm. Something close to 0.1 in magnitude  should  be
                good for most problems.

                AGS solver can automatically decrease radius, so too large
                radius is  not a problem (assuming that you  won't  choose
                so large radius that algorithm  will  sample  function  in
                too far away points, where gradient value is irrelevant).

                Too small radius won't cause algorithm to fail, but it may
                slow down algorithm (it may  have  to  perform  too  short
                steps).
    Penalty -   penalty coefficient for nonlinear constraints:
                * for problem with nonlinear constraints  should  be  some
                  problem-specific  positive   value,  large  enough  that
                  penalty term changes shape of the function.
                  Starting  from  some  problem-specific   value   penalty
                  coefficient becomes  large  enough  to  exactly  enforce
                  nonlinear constraints;  larger  values  do  not  improve
                  precision.
                  Increasing it too much may slow down convergence, so you
                  should choose it carefully.
                * can be zero for problems WITHOUT  nonlinear  constraints
                  (i.e. for unconstrained ones or ones with  just  box  or
                  linear constraints)
                * if you specify zero value for problem with at least  one
                  nonlinear  constraint,  algorithm  will  terminate  with
                  error code -1.

ALGORITHM OUTLINE

The very basic outline of unconstrained AGS algorithm is given below:

0. If sampling radius is below EpsX  or  we  performed  more  then  MaxIts
   iterations - STOP.
1. sample O(N) gradient values at random locations  around  current point;
   informally speaking, this sample is an implicit piecewise  linear model
   of the function, although algorithm formulation does  not  mention that
   explicitly
2. solve quadratic programming problem in order to find descent direction
3. if QP solver tells us that we  are  near  solution,  decrease  sampling
   radius and move to (0)
4. perform backtracking line search
5. after moving to new point, goto (0)

As for the constraints:
* box constraints are handled exactly  by  modification  of  the  function
  being minimized
* linear/nonlinear constraints are handled by adding L1  penalty.  Because
  our solver can handle nonsmoothness, we can  use  L1  penalty  function,
  which is an exact one  (i.e.  exact  solution  is  returned  under  such
  penalty).
* penalty coefficient for  linear  constraints  is  chosen  automatically;
  however, penalty coefficient for nonlinear constraints must be specified
  by user.

DESCRIPTION:
The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using one of  the
nonlinear conjugate gradient methods.

These CG methods are globally convergent (even on non-convex functions) as
long as grad(f) is Lipschitz continuous in  a  some  neighborhood  of  the
L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }.


REQUIREMENTS:
Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
* function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with MinCGCreate() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with MinCGSetCond(), MinCGSetStpMax() and
   other functions
3. User calls MinCGOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state   and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
4. User calls MinCGResults() to get solution
5. Optionally, user may call MinCGRestartFrom() to solve another  problem
   with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
   MinCGRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinCGCreate(). It uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinCGCreate() in order to get more
information about creation of CG optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X

    DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinCGSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less  robust  and  precise.  L-BFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
   Imprecise  gradient may slow down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
   nonlinear problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

/*************************************************************************
This function sets scaling coefficients for CG optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) "how large" the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of CG optimizer  -  step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In   most   optimizers  (and  in  the  CG  too)  scaling is NOT a form  of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner by separate call to one of the MinCGSetPrec...() functions.

There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

Suggested  step  length  is used as starting point for the line search. It
can be useful when you have  badly  scaled  problem,  i.e.  when  ||grad||
(which is used as initial estimate for the first step) is many  orders  of
magnitude different from the desired step.

Line search  may  fail  on  such problems without good estimate of initial
step length. Imagine, for example, problem with ||grad||=10^50 and desired
step equal to 0.1 Line  search function will use 10^50  as  initial  step,
then  it  will  decrease step length by 2 (up to 20 attempts) and will get
10^44, which is still too large.

This function allows us to tell than line search should  be  started  from
some moderate step length, like 1.0, so algorithm will be able  to  detect
desired step length in a several searches.

Default behavior (when no step is suggested) is to use preconditioner,  if
it is available, to generate initial estimate of step length.

This function influences only first iteration of algorithm. It  should  be
called between MinCGCreate/MinCGRestartFrom() call and MinCGOptimize call.
Suggested step is ignored if you have preconditioner.

Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
(note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
suspicious by the OptGuard.

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with mincgoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle

/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.

      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.

      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* mincgoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* mincgoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
    single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
    complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
  * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
    differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
    report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
    or MinLM)
* rep.nonc0suspected

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

INPUT PARAMETERS:

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.

      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  "unlucky"  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.

      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

Nonsmoothness (non-C1) test #0 studies  function  values  (not  gradient!)

derivative estimate.

This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the
gradient values and thus it is more robust against artifacts introduced by
numerical differentiation.

Two reports are returned:
* a "strongest" one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
  value of the nonsmoothness indicator
* a "longest" one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
  evaluations, and thus is more detailed

In both cases following fields are returned:

* positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
  did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
* x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
  for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
* stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function

Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the

When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
continuity is violated.

DESCRIPTION:
This function is used to find minimum of function which is represented  as
sum of squares:
    F(x) = f[0]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1]) + ... + f[m-1]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1])

REQUIREMENTS:
This algorithm will request following information during its operation:

* function vector f[] at given point X
* function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[] (simultaneously) at given point

There are several overloaded versions of  MinLMOptimize()  function  which
correspond  to  different LM-like optimization algorithms provided by this
unit. You should choose version which accepts fvec()  and jac() callbacks.
First  one  is used to calculate f[] at given point, second one calculates

You can try to initialize MinLMState structure with VJ  function and  then
use incorrect version  of  MinLMOptimize()  (for  example,  version  which
works  with  general  form function and does not provide Jacobian), but it
will  lead  to  exception  being  thrown  after first attempt to calculate
Jacobian.


USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLMCreateVJ() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLMSetCond(),  MinLMSetStpMax() and
   other functions
3. User calls MinLMOptimize() function which  takes algorithm  state   and

This function sets scaling coefficients for LM optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) "how large" the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Generally, scale is NOT considered to be a form of preconditioner.  But LM
optimizer is unique in that it uses scaling matrix both  in  the  stopping
condition tests and as Marquardt damping factor.

Proper scaling is very important for the algorithm performance. It is less
important for the quality of results, but still has some influence (it  is
easier  to  converge  when  variables  are  properly  scaled, so premature
stopping is possible when very badly scalled variables are  combined  with
relaxed stopping conditions).

/*************************************************************************
This function sets general linear constraints for LM optimizer

Linear constraints are inactive by default (after initial creation).  They
are preserved until explicitly turned off with another minlmsetlc() call.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    C       -   linear constraints, array[K,N+1].
                Each row of C represents one constraint, either equality
                or inequality (see below):
                * first N elements correspond to coefficients,
                * last element corresponds to the right part.
                All elements of C (including right part) must be finite.
    CT      -   type of constraints, array[K]:
                * if CT[i]>0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x >= C[i,n+1]
                * if CT[i]=0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x  = C[i,n+1]
                * if CT[i]<0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x <= C[i,n+1]
    K       -   number of equality/inequality constraints, K>=0:
                * if given, only leading K elements of C/CT are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from sizes of C/CT

IMPORTANT: if you have linear constraints, it is strongly  recommended  to
           set scale of variables with minlmsetscale(). QP solver which is
           used to calculate linearly constrained steps heavily relies  on
           good scaling of input problems.

IMPORTANT: solvers created with minlmcreatefgh()  do  not  support  linear
           constraints.

NOTE: linear  (non-bound)  constraints are satisfied only approximately  -
      there  always  exists some violation due  to  numerical  errors  and
      algorithmic limitations.

NOTE: general linear constraints  add  significant  overhead  to  solution
      process. Although solver performs roughly same amount of  iterations
      (when compared  with  similar  box-only  constrained  problem), each
      iteration   now    involves  solution  of  linearly  constrained  QP
      subproblem, which requires ~3-5 times more Cholesky  decompositions.
      Thus, if you can reformulate your problem in such way  this  it  has
      only box constraints, it may be beneficial to do so.

This function is used to change acceleration settings

You can choose between three acceleration strategies:
* AccType=0, no acceleration.
* AccType=1, secant updates are used to update quadratic model after  each
  iteration. After fixed number of iterations (or after  model  breakdown)
  we  recalculate  quadratic  model  using  analytic  Jacobian  or  finite
  differences. Number of secant-based iterations depends  on  optimization
  settings: about 3 iterations - when we have analytic Jacobian, up to 2*N
  iterations - when we use finite differences to calculate Jacobian.

AccType=1 is recommended when Jacobian  calculation  cost is prohibitively
high (several Mx1 function vector calculations  followed  by  several  NxN
Cholesky factorizations are faster than calculation of one M*N  Jacobian).
It should also be used when we have no Jacobian, because finite difference
approximation takes too much time to compute.

Table below list  optimization  protocols  (XYZ  protocol  corresponds  to
MinLMCreateXYZ) and acceleration types they support (and use by  default).

it during algorithm iterations may result in unexpected behavior.

NOTES:

1. Depending on function used to create state  structure,  this  algorithm
   may accept Jacobian and/or Hessian and/or gradient.  According  to  the
   said above, there ase several versions of this function,  which  accept
   different sets of callbacks.

   This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
   MinLMCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
   does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
   will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.

   Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
   compile time - you can see them at runtime only.

/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
analytic Jacobian.

Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
numerical differentiation of your target function vector  at  the  initial
point (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the final  point)
and compares numerical Jacobian with analytic one provided by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which stores  both  Jacobians,  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
suspicious by the OptGuard.

The OptGuard report can be retrieved with minlmoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep>0 activates verification
                    You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                    numerical derivative.

                    You may use different step for different parameters by
                    means of setting scale with minlmsetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

OptGuard checks analytic Jacobian  against  reference  value  obtained  by
numerical differentiation with user-specified step.

NOTE: other optimizers perform additional OptGuard checks for things  like
      C0/C1-continuity violations. However, LM optimizer  can  check  only
      for incorrect Jacobian.

      The reason is that unlike line search methods LM optimizer does  not
      perform extensive evaluations along the line. Thus, we simply do not
      have enough data to catch C0/C1-violations.

This check is activated with  minlmoptguardgradient() function.

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradfidx for specific function (Jacobian row) suspected
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (Jacobian column) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient/Jacobian is tested
