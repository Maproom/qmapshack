This installation of QMapShack for Windows (short: QMS) 
has been build with Visual Studio 2017 as 64bit application.

If you want to build QMS on your own, have a look at

The QMS source code is available at https://github.com/Maproom/qmapshack

Dependencies
============
QMS depends on the 3rd party software listed below:

1.) Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable Package
  The installer vcredist_x64.exe (ca 7MB size) as downloaded from
    https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads
  is already contained in the QMS Installer package and will be executed if selected by the user.

  Note: Those runtime libraries may already be contained in Windows 10 installations.

2.) Qt5 runtime libraries
  The Qt libraries are deployed in the QMS installation directory.
  Qt is used according the GPLv3 open source License
    See https://www.qt.io/download-open-source and https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html

3.) The GDAL library, http://www.gdal.org/

4.) The PROJ library http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/

5.) Icons for the Windows Start Menu ==> We should get rid of them and use own icons
    kfm_home.ico has been created from the Nuvola 1.0 icon set (http://www.icon-king.com/projects/nuvola/)
    gdalicon.ico has been converted from gdalicon.png from the GDAL package

6.) The routino library
  Source code is available http://www.routino.org/
  This QMapShack installation uses a routino library which is precompiled with mingw64 to reduce porting efforts

7.) MinGW64,  http://mingw-w64.org
  The mingw64 compiler is used to compile the routino library.
  This resulting library depends from mingw64 runtime libraries such as libwinpthread-1.dll, libz-1.dll
  which are also included in this installation

8.) MariaDB, https://mariadb.com/
  For MySql/MariaDB support, the Qt mysql plugin needs libmysql.dll.
  This DLL can be downloaded as part of the precompiled MariaDB binaries at https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/+releases/
  For the current QMS binary distribution, libmysql.dll is taken from mariadb version 10.1.34: 
  https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/10.1.34 --> mariadb-10.1.34-winx64.zip
