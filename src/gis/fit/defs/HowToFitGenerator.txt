How To Generate FIT Master Data
-------------------------------
The source code for the fit decoder has several places with the comments:

// ----------- start generated code -----------
// ----------- end generated code -----------

The code in between these comments is generated. 

The files with generated code are:
- /src/gis/fit/defs/CFitProfileLookup.cpp   contains the fit profiles (message and field)
- /src/gis/fit/defs/fit_enums.h             contains the global message numbers plus enumerations for field values
- /src/gis/fit/defs/fit_fields.h            contains all field def numbers 


The input for the generator are two CSV files (beware the line ending must be line ending unix):
- Profile_Messages.csv
- Profile_Types.csv

These csv files are the export from the Excel "Profiles.xlsx" within the FIT SDK (Current Version 20.27).

The generator "profiles.py" is a python script and needs python 2.7.
The generator creates separate files. The code must be placed at the corresponding source code manually 
(in between the above mentioned comments).
The generator creates files with the same name as the files mentioned above plus a prefix "gen-" 
in the same directory as it has been executed:
- e.g. gen-fit_enums.h is the source for the file fit_enums.h

The generator is not part of the build, so it must be executed manually.
These files should be deleted after copying the code into the corresponding source files.
Do not add these generated files to the repository.
